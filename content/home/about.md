# About Me

I'm a quantitative ecologist using data science, modeling, and synthetic approaches to solve interdisciplinary environmental problems, particularly in the sea. Ultimately, I aim to improve how humans understand, manage, and use nature. Most of my [research](http://www.alexafredston.com/#research) investigates marine biogeographic patterns and ecological processes, how human influences are reshaping them, and how well their dynamics can be predicted with models. I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ocean Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/). **I am recruiting PhD students this year. Prospective lab members can learn more about opportunities [here](http://www.alexafredston.com/#join).**

Although research is my focus, I am continually striving to translate science into action. As a postdoc, I collaborated with managers and fishermen through the [Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council](http://www.mafmc.org/). Before starting my PhD, I worked for two years at the [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/) as a High Meadows Fellow. I've also served on [CESAB](Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and [SNAPP](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) working groups, aimed at synthesizing ecological information to advance biodiversity conservation and human well-being. I am always open to collaboration, particularly via partnerships that emphasize sustaining nature and people. 

I'm committed to science communication and open science. I am on the Board of Directors of the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.sortee.org/) and the Steering Committee for [FISHGLOB](https://fishglob.sites.ucsc.edu). All of the code for my published research, as well as numerous coding tutorials I developed, can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/afredston). I've also spoken to broad audiences of R users [about ecology and environmental science](https://github.com/afredston/R-for-the-planet). Links to watch those presentations and some other recorded talks can be found [on this site](https://www.alexafredston.com/#videos). 

When I'm not at my desk, I can usually be found at the farmer's market or doing community service. I've previously volunteered in [mentoring  at-risk youth in Trenton, NJ](https://www.lifeties.org/programs/t-i-l-t-mentoring/), [street medicine for the homeless and uninsured](https://sbdww.org/), [mountain rescue](https://www.bamru.org/), [emergency medical services](https://pfars.org/), and [outdoor education for people of all abilities](https://discovernac.org/), to name a few.
