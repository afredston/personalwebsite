# About Me

I'm an ecologist using data science and synthetic approaches to address interdisciplinary environmental problems. Ultimately, I aim to improve how humans understand, manage, and use nature. Most of my [research](({{< ref "content/home/research.md" >}})) investigates how human activities alter biogeographic patterns and ecological processes. 

I'm also passionate about science communication and open science. I learned most of my R coding skills from the [eco-data-science](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) group, which promotes open science and knowledge sharing in the Santa Barbara environmental science community. I'm still learning, but I've also begun teaching introductory workshops on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

Before starting my PhD, I worked for two years at the [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/) as a High Meadows Fellow. I've also served on a [Science for Nature and People Partnership](https://snappartnership.net/) working group. Although my focus is on research, I am continually striving to translate science into action.
