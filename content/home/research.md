I study ecological processes and biogeographical patterns, in the context of human impacts. My work falls into three main areas:

## Biogeography and Climate Change 

Species around the globe are shifting their ranges in response to climate change. However, many ecological and environmental processes besides climate also influence species distributions. Without understanding these other processes and how they interact with one another and with climate, it’s difficult to predict range shifts and make management recommendations. My research aims to advance our mechanistic understanding of processes that govern species distributions in the Anthropocene. My postdoctoral research will field-test a process-based model to forecast species distributions on short time scales. In my PhD, I conducted empirical analyses using biodiversity survey data to test how well range edges of marine species have tracked temperature over time. I have also studied the implications of climate-related range shifts for marine protected area design. 

## Sustainable Fisheries and Livelihoods

Fishing has the potential to provide protein with a low greenhouse gas footprint to billions of people, and to support livelihoods in countless coastal communities. Unfortunately, most fisheries in the world are associated with problematic social or ecological outcomes—or both. I've engaged with fisheries both through primary research and through collaboration and outreach with stakeholders. In my postdoctoral research, I'm partnering with fishers and managers in the Mid-Atlantic region to inform the design and field-testing of process-based models for short-term species distribution forecasting. During my High Meadows Fellowship at the Environmental Defense Fund (2012-2014), I worked to improve the economic viability of the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery. I continue to engage with fisheries management as a consultant, and am also involved in academic projects focused on social dimensions of fisheries management. 

## Coastal Ecosystems and Runoff

Coastal marine ecosystems, such as seagrass beds and coral reefs, support tremendous biodiversity and ecosystem services. These habitats experience a multitude of human impacts, but often the most damaging is the direct influx of sediments, nutrients, and other forms of pollution in runoff from rivers. As an undergraduate, I compared the molluscan community of fossilized vs. modern coral reefs in Caribbean Panama, finding a significant transition away from herbivores and toward filter-feeders over time—consistent with increased nutrient pollution as humans developed agriculture in the area. I also participated in a Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP) working group on Ridges to Reef Fisheries, working to design decision support tools for land-sea management in data-poor coastal regions. At UCSB, I mentored several undergraduate and masters thesis projects related to freshwater and coastal ecosystems.
