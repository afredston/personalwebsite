I study ecological processes and biogeographic patterns, in the context of human impacts. My work falls into three main areas:

## Biogeography and Climate Change 

Species around the globe are shifting their ranges in response to climate change. However, many ecological and environmental processes besides climate also influence species distributions. Without understanding these other processes and how they interact with another and with climate, it’s difficult to predict range shifts and make management recommendations. My research aims to advance our mechanistic understanding of processes that govern range edges in the Anthropocene. Currently, I am exploring whether life history traits related to mobility and dispersal influence how marine species track climate change, via an empirical analysis of large-scale time series data. I have also studied the implications of climate-related range shifts for marine protected area design. 

## Coastal Ecosystems and Runoff

Coastal marine ecosystems, such as seagrass beds and coral reefs, support tremendous biodiversity and ecosystem services. These habitats experience a multitude of human impacts, but often the most damaging is the direct influx of sediments, nutrients, and other forms of pollution in runoff from rivers. As an undergraduate, I compared the molluscan community of fossilized vs. modern coral reefs in Caribbean Panama, finding a significant transition away from herbivores and toward filter-feeders over time—consistent with increased nutrient pollution as humans developed agriculture in the area. I also participated in a Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP) working group on Ridges to Reef Fisheries, working to design decision support tools for land-sea management in data-poor coastal regions. 

## Sustainable Fisheries and Livelihoods

Fishing has the potential to provide protein with a low greenhouse gas footprint to billions of people, and to support livelihoods in countless coastal communities. Unfortunately, most fisheries in the world are associated with problematic social or ecological outcomes—or both. During my High Meadows Fellowship at the Environmental Defense Fund (2012-2014), I worked toward building the economic viability of the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery. The fishery was managed under an individual fishing quota system, which had yielded remarkable ecological benefits but was not yet profitable for fishers. I continue to engage with fisheries management as a consultant, and am also involved in several academic projects focused on social dimensions of fisheries management.
