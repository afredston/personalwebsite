In January 2023, I will move to [Ocean Sciences at UC Santa Cruz](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/index.html). UCSC is on the cutting edge of environmental and marine research. Strong support exists for interdisciplinary work and partnerships, via the [Institute for Marine Sciences](https://ims.ucsc.edu/), [NOAA's Southwest Fishery Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center), and more.  I encourage prospective graduate students to explore the Ocean Sciences [prospective student page](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/about/prosp-student-resources.html).

I am always open to co-developing proposals for fellowships and other externally funded positions. Many lists exist of national fellowships; you may find some relevant graduate fellowships on this [University of Miami page](https://graduate.rsmas.miami.edu/phd-and-ms-programs/ocean-sciences/national-fellowships-awards/index.html), some postdoc fellowships on this [University of Minnesota page](https://cbs.umn.edu/academics/departments/eeb/postdocs/opportunities), and both on [Dr. Jurgens' page](https://jurgenslab.com/grad-postdoc-funding/). I may also have additional funding for students and postdocs to join the lab. Prospective lab members should email me directly. I encourage you to include the following in your email:

1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of your background and career goals.

1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of why you want to come to UCSC, and to my lab specifically. 

1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of a project you are interested in working on. (This is not binding in any way, but will give me a sense of what you are excited about and how you think.)

3. Your current CV and (for prospective undergrad or grad students) an unofficial transcript.
