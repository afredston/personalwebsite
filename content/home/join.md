Thank you for your interest in joining the lab. Starting January 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor in [Ocean Sciences at UC Santa Cruz](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/index.html). UCSC is on the cutting edge of environmental and marine research. Strong support exists for interdisciplinary work and partnerships, via the [Institute for Marine Sciences](https://ims.ucsc.edu/), [NOAA's Southwest Fishery Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center), and more. I encourage prospective graduate students to explore the Ocean Sciences [prospective student page](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/about/prosp-student-resources.html), including the [program prerequisites listed here](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Physical-and-Biological-Sciences-Division/Ocean-Sciences).

The Fredston Lab is a computational group that develops and tests hypotheses about fundamental dynamics of marine ecosystems using theoretical models and Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Successful Fredston Lab members are likely to have experience and/or substantial interest in these methods. In other words, there is a lot of math, probability, and code involved, and most people in the group will not be collecting primary (field or lab) data. That said, I am open to a broad array of approaches to answering these questions, and committed to training early career researchers in quantitative methods. 

I am always open to co-developing proposals for fellowships and other externally funded positions, and I expect PhD students in the lab to apply to national fellowships for which they are eligible. Many lists exist of national fellowships; you may find some relevant graduate fellowships on this [University of Miami page](https://graduate.rsmas.miami.edu/phd-and-ms-programs/ocean-sciences/national-fellowships-awards/index.html), some postdoc fellowships on this [University of Minnesota page](https://cbs.umn.edu/academics/departments/eeb/postdocs/opportunities), and both on [Dr. Jurgens' page](https://jurgenslab.com/grad-postdoc-funding/). Johns Hopkins University also maintains lists of [graduate](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/graduate/) and [postdoctoral](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/) fellowships for all research fields. I may also have additional funding for students and postdocs to join the lab. Prospective lab members should email me directly. I encourage you to include the following in your email:

1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of your background and career goals.

1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of why you want to come to UCSC, and to my lab specifically. 
1. A short summary (one paragraph or less) of a project you are interested in working on. (This is not binding in any way, but will give me a sense of what you are excited about and how you think. You can alternatively send a research proposal you've written, like an NSF GRFP application.)

1. Your current CV and (for prospective undergrad or grad students) unofficial transcripts.
