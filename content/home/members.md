**Dr. Alexa Fredston** is a quantitative ecologist and Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ocean Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz](https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/). She earned her Ph.D. from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University with a B.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a certificate in Environmental Studies. Dr. Fredston's publications are listed on her [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zStqHYEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexa_Fredston-Hermann2/) pages. You can contact her for PDFs of any publications, and {{% staticref "files/CV_Fredston_website.pdf" %}}download her CV here.{{% /staticref %}}

Dr. Fredston is committed to translating science into action. As a postdoc, she collaborated with managers and fishermen through the [Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council](http://www.mafmc.org/). Previously, she worked at the [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/) as a High Meadows Fellow. She has served on [CESAB](Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and [SNAPP](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) working groups, aimed at synthesizing ecological information to advance biodiversity conservation and human well-being. Dr. Fredston is Treasurer of the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.sortee.org/) (and was on the Board of Directors from 2022 -- 2024) and the Steering Committee for [FISHGLOB](https://fishglob.sites.ucsc.edu). All of the code for her published research, as well as numerous coding tutorials she developed, can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/afredston). A number of her recorded talks can be found [on this site](https://www.alexafredston.com/#videos). 

**Dr. Emma Walker** is a postdoctoral scholar in the Fredston Lab working on both developing and applying theory that better resolves the nonlinear dynamics present in ecological systems. The aim of her research is to further understanding of the interplay of fundamental processes and address their consequences for ensuring the sustainability of populations. One of the main projects she is currently working on is using empirical dynamical modelling to discover whether marine heatwaves have had nonlinear consequences on fish species abundances in the bottom trawl surveys of the North Eastern United States. She is also interested in and working on how spatiotemporal variability impacts the size and rates of change of species' populations and ranges.

**Jordana Sevigny** joined the Fredston Lab in 2023 as a PhD student in Ocean Sciences. Prior to moving to Santa Cruz, Jordana worked in Seattle in several labs researching transmissible cancer in bivalves, evolution and ecology of microbes, and alpine wildflower ecology and citizen science. Jordana holds a B.S. in Biology with an emphasis in Ecology from University of Washington. In the Fredston Lab, Jordana's research centers on mechanistic modeling of marine invertebrate species' dispersion and range edge dynamics. Outside of lab, Jordana enjoys many hobbies including kayaking, camping, reading, and crafting.

**Theodore Tran** is a PhD student and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow interested in investigating questions of ecology among sharks and other large, mobile marine predators. He earned in BS in Marine Biology at San Jose University. He aims to integrate and synthesize interdisciplinary methods to establish factors and trends in migratory patterns and habitat use in light of anthropogenic impacts and climate change.
